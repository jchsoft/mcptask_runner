# ci-start

Internal helper skill invoked by `/ci-runner`. Runs a single shell script and returns its output verbatim.

## Task

1. Run: `~/.claude/bin/ci_start`
2. Return the stdout of that command as your entire reply, unchanged. No summary, no prose, no commentary.

## Output contract

The script always exits 0 and emits one of three blocks. Return exactly what it prints:

**When lock is acquired and CI launched:**
```
CI_STARTED
CI_LOG=<absolute path to log file>
EXPECTED_SEC=<integer>
```

**When another agent holds the lock:**
```
CI_LOCKED
OTHER_LOG=<absolute path or "unknown">
OTHER_PROJECT=<absolute path>
OTHER_REMAINING=<string like "12m 34s" or "overdue by Xs" or "unknown">
```

**On error:**
```
CI_ERROR
REASON=<short identifier>
<diagnostic lines>
```

Do not interpret, summarize, or wrap these lines. The orchestrator (`/ci-runner`) parses them.
